On Unix,Linux system, simply launch  make in the current directory and
the binaries should be in the local "bin" directory. After compilation
you can launch 'make clean' to delete the temporary objects.

You  need  the CFITSIO  library  for  spaddi  to work.  Hopefully  the
installation script will figure out where  it is else you need to edit
the 'Makefile' in the 'src' directory and modify the variable FITS_INC
and FITS_LIB to reflect your system configuration.

When the installation is done, launch spaddi with '-h' for the list of
options.

Enjoy,
